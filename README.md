# Customer Management API (Hexagonal Architecture with Spring Boot and RabbitMQ)

[Portugu√™s Brasileiro üåê](README.pt-br.md)

This project is a RESTful API for customer management, developed with **Spring Boot** and following the principles of **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**. The main goal is to demonstrate a decoupled, testable, and easily maintainable software design, utilizing asynchronous communication with **RabbitMQ** for sending welcome emails.

## üöÄ Features

* **Customer CRUD**: Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete customer records.
* **JWT Security**: Endpoints are secured with JSON Web Token-based authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access resources.
* **Data Validation**: Input data validation to ensure data integrity.
* **Asynchronous Communication**: Sending welcome emails to new customers via a message queue with RabbitMQ, ensuring resilience and scalability.
* **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between business logic (domain) and infrastructure details (adapters), promoting high cohesion and low coupling.

## üìê Architecture

The application is built following the **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)**, which consists of:

* **Domain (Core)**: Contains the main business logic (`Cliente`, `ClienteService`), independent of frameworks or external technologies. It interacts with the outside world only through **Ports** (interfaces).
* **Ports (Interfaces)**:
    * **Driving Ports (Inbound Ports)**: Define the operations the application offers (e.g., `ClienteServicePort`).
    * **Driven Ports (Outbound Ports)**: Define the operations the application needs from external services (e.g., `ClienteRepositoryPort`, `EmailServicePort`).
* **Adapters (Implementations)**:
    * **Driving Adapters (Inbound Adapters)**: Implement the driving ports (e.g., `ClienteController` for HTTP, `WelcomeEmailMessageListener` for RabbitMQ).
    * **Driven Adapters (Outbound Adapters)**: Implement the driven ports (e.g., `ClienteJpaRepositoryAdapter` for JPA persistence, `RabbitMQEmailServiceAdapter` for sending messages to RabbitMQ).

This structure promotes testability, flexibility for technology changes, and clarity in design.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Java 17+**
* **Spring Boot 3.2.5+**
* **Spring Security** (for authentication and authorization)
* **JJWT (Java JWT)** (for creating and validating JWT tokens)
* **Spring Data JPA**
* **H2 Database** (for development and testing - easily replaceable)
* **Lombok**
* **Spring AMQP** (for RabbitMQ integration)
* **RabbitMQ** (as a message broker)
* **Maven** (dependency manager)

## üß™ Testing Strategy

This project adopts a layered testing strategy, leveraging the benefits of Hexagonal Architecture to ensure code quality and functionality reliability.

### Implemented Test Types:

* **Unit Tests:**
    * **Focus:** Pure business logic (Domain).
    * **Example:** `ClienteServiceTest`.
    * **Verifies:** Business rules, validations, and interactions with Ports (mocks).
    * **Tools:** JUnit 5, Mockito.

* **Persistence Integration Tests:**
    * **Focus:** Interaction between the domain layer and data persistence.
    * **Example:** `ClienteJpaRepositoryAdapterTest`.
    * **Verifies:** ORM mapping and database operations (using in-memory H2 Database).
    * **Tools:** JUnit 5, Spring Boot `@DataJpaTest`.

* **Messaging Integration Tests (Mock):**
    * **Focus:** Interaction between the outbound adapter (producer) and the messaging client in isolation, without requiring a real message broker.
    * **Example:** `RabbitMQEmailServiceAdapterMockTest.java`.
    * **Verifies:** The correct invocation of the `RabbitTemplate`, ensuring that the expected exchange, routing key, and properly serialized JSON payload are sent.
    * **Tools:** JUnit 5, Spring Boot `@SpringBootTest`, `@MockBean`, Mockito.

* **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
    * **Focus:** Full application flow, simulating the user journey, including API HTTP, database persistence, and asynchronous communication.
    * **Example:** `ClienteE2ETest`.
    * **Verifies:** HTTP requests, business logic, DB saving, and message sending/processing via RabbitMQ, from a complete flow perspective.
    * **Tools:** JUnit 5, Spring Boot `@SpringBootTest`, Testcontainers (for RabbitMQ and dedicated H2 database), `WebTestClient`, Awaitility (for asynchronous assertions).

    * **Note on Consumer E2E Test:**
    To verify asynchronous message processing by `WelcomeEmailMessageListener` in E2E tests, a `public static AtomicBoolean messageProcessedForE2E` flag was temporarily added to the production listener's code. **It is important to note that this is a didactic technique to simplify test synchronization.** In a real production environment, the listener's code should not contain test-specific logic. Consumer processing verification would ideally be done through persistent side effects (e.g., database status) or with more advanced testing tools that replace the email service with a mock that logs calls.

### How to Run Tests:

Ensure **Docker is running** for Testcontainers to start the RabbitMQ container.

From the project root, execute the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn clean install # Compiles the project and its test classes
mvn test          # Executes all tests (unit, integration, and E2E)
```

## üì¶ How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

* **JDK 17+**
* **Maven 3.x**
* **Docker** (recommended for running RabbitMQ and H2, although H2 can run in-memory)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/andersonaoliveira/springboot-hexagonal-rabbitmq-customer-api.git](https://github.com/andersonaoliveira/springboot-hexagonal-rabbitmq-customer-api.git)
cd springboot-hexagonal-rabbitmq-customer-api
````

### 2\. Configure RabbitMQ with Docker

Ensure Docker is running.
Open a terminal and execute:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management
```

The RabbitMQ management interface will be available at `http://localhost:15672` (username: `guest`, password: `guest`).

### 3\. Run the Spring Boot Application

Navigate to the project's root directory and execute:

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start on port `8080`.

### 4\. Access H2 Console (Optional)

During development, you can access the H2 console at:
`http://localhost:8080/h2-console`
Use the following credentials:

  * **JDBC URL:** `jdbc:h2:mem:clientedb`
  * **User Name:** `sa`
  * **Password:** (leave blank)

## üß™ Testing the API

With the security implementation, most endpoints are now secured. To test them, you must first obtain an authentication token and then use it in subsequent requests.

You can use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or `curl` to test the endpoints.

### 1. Obtain an Authentication Token

Send a `POST` request to the `/login` endpoint with the demo user's credentials.

```bash
POST http://localhost:8080/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "username": "admin",
    "password": "password"
}
```

* **Expected Response:** `200 OK` with a body containing the JWT.
    ```json
    {
        "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJDbGllbnRlIEFQSSIsInN1YiI6ImFkbWluIiwiaWF0IjoxNzE3MjgyODAwLCJleHAiOjE3MTcyODY0MDB9.xxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "type": "Bearer"
    }
    ```
* **Next Step:** Copy the value from the `"token"` field to use in the next tests.

### 2. Create a New Customer (Public Endpoint)

This endpoint remains public and does not require authentication.

```bash
POST http://localhost:8080/clientes
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "nome": "Anderson Oliveira",
    "email": "anderson.oliveira@example.com",
    "cpf": "12345678901"
}
```

* **Expected Response:** `201 Created` with the customer data and the generated ID.

### 3. Get Customers and Get Customer by ID (Public Endpoint)

These endpoints remain public and do not require authentication.

```bash
GET http://localhost:8080/clientes
```
```bash
GET http://localhost:8080/clientes/{customer_id}
```

* **Example:** `GET http://localhost:8080/clientes/1`
* **Expected Response:** `200 OK` with the customer data.

### 4. Update a Customer (Secured Endpoint)

This endpoint is also secured and requires the token.

```bash
PUT http://localhost:8080/clientes/{customer_id}
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_JWT}

{
    "nome": "Anderson Updated",
    "email": "anderson.updated@example.com",
    "cpf": "12345678901"
}
```

* **Expected Response:** `200 OK` with the updated data or `404 Not Found`.

### 5. Delete a Customer (Secured Endpoint)

This endpoint is secured and requires the token.

```bash
DELETE http://localhost:8080/clientes/{customer_id}
Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_JWT}
```

* **Expected Response:** `204 No Content` or `404 Not Found`.
